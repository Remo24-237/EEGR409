Note that the difference between the scanf function and the fscanf function is that the first argument in the fscanf function is the file pointer. Otherwise, both statements are the same. The scanf statement converts the characters received from the keyboard to values, and the fscanf statement converts the characters received from the lines in the data file to values. If the file is an output file, we can write information to the file with the fprintf function. The first argument of the fprintf statement is the file pointer, and the rest of the argument define the variables and the form in which the corresponding values are to be written in the file. For example, consider the program developed earlier in this chapter that computed the sum of two waves. If we want to modify this program so that it generates a data file containing this set of data, we could use a pointer waves that would be associated with an output file named waves1.txt using these statements.
